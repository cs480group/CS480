# User ReadMe

To use the program launch it with the TAscheduler.exe

You must enter both a Student.csv file and a Schedule.csv file which MUST be the same name
You do this by clicking on the Student.csv button or the Schedule.csv button

You then need to press run. When the program is complete the Bottom right text box will display “Program is Complete”.
When the program is finished a new CSV file will be placed within the same folder as the TAscheduler.exe file called “TA_Assignment_File.csv”


# Current bugs

If One or more required csv files are not inputted then the program will output an empty csv file.
If there is already a csv file named “TA_Assignment_File.csv” in the same directory as the exe file it will be overwritten.
The student and scheduler files need to be formatted in a specific way otherwise it will not work
